<b>What is an Overlay Network?</b>
  
When working with Docker in a single-host environment, bridge networks are often sufficient to connect your containers. 
But what happens when your application scales and you need to run containers across multiple Docker hosts? 
This is where <b>overlay networks</b> come into play.

<b>Prerequisites:</b>
Before diving into overlay networks, make sure you have:
Docker Engine installed on multiple hosts
Basic understanding of Docker networking concepts
Docker Swarm initialized (for most overlay network features)
