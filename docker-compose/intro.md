  Docker compose is another way to interact wih docker engine.
  wrapper in python to interact with docker engine;

  docker compose version 2-->version 3
  3 is dependent on 2.
  It uses manifest to communicate to docker engine, instead of using command 
  like: docker service create, docker service update,  docker service scale......, 
  it uses manifest or template in yml format.
